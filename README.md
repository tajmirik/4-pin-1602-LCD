# 4-pin-1602-LCD
Drive an alphanumeric 1602 LCD only using 3 pins from your microcontroller, my MCU was ATMEGA32.
You can find the entire main code and simulation (in Proteus).
I need to know if there is some function left but if you have access to the LCD datasheet and you wanna send your commands and data you can use "command(unsigned char ----)" and "data (unsigned char ----) commands to simply communicate with LCD.
